***All demos have been tested against Ubuntu 18.04 and Kubernetes 1.22.4***

If you have any issues please feel free to reach out.

The course downloads have been updated and tested with 1.22.4. The installation of containerd and the bootstrapping of a cluster with kubeadm are 
dramatically simpler than in the 1.21 version which is what's in the course video at the moment.

- Key updates
1. Setting the systemd cgroup driver in config.toml...the two lines I added in the video are now there by default. You just have to change SystemdCgroup = false to SystemdCgroup = true
2. You no longer need to create and edit ClusterConfiguration.yaml 
3. kubeadm 1.22 removed the need to use the parameters --config=ClusterConfiguration.yaml and --cri-socket /run/containerd/containerd.sock these parameters are no longer needed
